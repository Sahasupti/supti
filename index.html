              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>During the early 9th century the greater Chittagong area, 
                including Cox's Bazar, was under the rule of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakhine_State">Arakan</a> kings until its
                 conquest by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire">Mughals</a> in 1666.
                [6] When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing through the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on his way to Arakan,
                 he was attracted to its scenic and captivating beauty. He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins 
                 stopped there for some time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins", still exists in the area. After the Mughals,
                  the place came under the control of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.</p>
